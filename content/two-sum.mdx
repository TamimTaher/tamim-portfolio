Hi there!

Today I'll be showing you my solution to LeetCode: All Topics Problem 1. Two Sum.

## LeetCode Problem: Two Sum (Solution)

Here's my solution:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in range(i+1, len(nums)):
                if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                    return [i, j]
```

## LeetCode Problem: Two Sum (Explanation)

Here's my explanation:

### 1. Class Solution

```python
class Solution(object):
```
- This defines a class called **Solution**.
- In Python, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. It groups related methods (functions) together.

### 2. Function Definition

```python
def twoSum(self, nums, target):
```
- This defines a method named **twoSum** inside the **Solution** class.
- **self** is a reference to the current instance of the class (**Solution**). It's always the first parameter in a method inside a class and allows the method to access instance variables and other methods within the class.
- **nums** is the list of integers provided as input, where the function will search for two numbers that add up to the **target**.
- **target** is the integer value that the function needs to find as the sum of two distinct numbers from **nums**.

### 3. Outer for Loop (Iterating over the list)

```python
for i in range(len(nums)):
```
- This loop iterates over the list **nums** using index **i**. It goes from the first element to the second-to-last element.
- **i** is the index of the first number that will be checked.

### 4. Inner for Loop (Checking pairs)

```python
for j in range(i+1, len(nums)):
```
- For each number **nums[i]**, this inner loop checks all the subsequent numbers in the list (those with indices greater than **i**). It starts from **i + 1** to avoid checking the same number twice.
- **j** is the index of the second number that will be checked.

### 5. Condition to Check if the Two Numbers Add Up to the Target

```python
if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
```
- This line checks if the sum of **nums[i]** and **nums[j]** equals the **target**.
- If the condition is true, meaning the two numbers add up to the target, the function returns the indices of these two numbers as a list: **[i, j]**.

### 6. Return the Indices of the Two Numbers

```python
return [i, j]
```
- When a pair of numbers that adds up to the target is found, the function returns a list containing their indices: **[i, j]**.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(nÂ²)**, where **n** is the number of elements in **nums**.
- This is because, for each element in the outer loop, the inner loop iterates over the remaining elements, leading to a nested loop structure.
- As a result, this approach is less efficient for large input sizes.

### Example

Suppose **nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]** and **target = 9**.

- First iteration: (**i = 0** and **nums[i] = 2**):
  - Inner loop starts with **j = 1** (**nums[j] = 7**):
    - **2 + 7 == 9**, so the function returns **[0, 1]**.

The result is **[0, 1]**, which are the indices of the two numbers that sum up to the target.

## LeetCode Problem: Two Sum (One of the Fastest Solution)

You've looked at my solution. But what if you want to do it in **O(n)** time?**O(n)** space? One of the fastest solutions I've seen in LeetCode is:

```python
class Solution(object):
 def twoSum(self, nums, target):
    num_map = {}  
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in num_map:
            return [num_map[complement], i] 
        num_map[num] = i  
    return [] 
```

Here's what so good about this solution:

- **O(n)** time complexity
- **O(n)** space complexity

## Conclusion

I hope you enjoyed my solution to LeetCode: All Topics Problem 1. Two Sum. I've also provided an explanation of how it works. Then, I have also provided the fastest solution in LeetCode, which is **O(n)** time and space complexity.
